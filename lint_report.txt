=== C Code Linter Report ===
Generated for: command_monitor.c

=== SUMMARY ===
✓ No unsafe string functions (strcpy, strcat, sprintf) - using safe alternatives
✓ Memory allocations have corresponding free() calls
✓ All includes appear to be used
✓ No obvious undefined variable references
⚠ Some magic numbers found (could be constants)
⚠ Some potential null pointer checks could be improved

=== DETAILED FINDINGS ===

1. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
   ✓ realloc() usage in http_write_callback() - properly checked and freed
   ✓ All free() calls present for allocated memory
   ✓ No obvious memory leaks detected

2. BUFFER SAFETY
   ✓ Using snprintf() instead of sprintf() - safe
   ✓ Using strncpy() with size limits - safe
   ✓ Buffer sizes defined as constants (MAX_PATH, COMMAND_BUFFER_SIZE, etc.)

3. MAGIC NUMBERS (Consider defining as constants):
   - Line 52: 256 (registry_key_name size)
   - Line 95: 1024 (g_ps_cmd size)
   - Line 96: 512 (g_reg_path size)
   - Line 239: 200 (HTTP status code)
   - Line 520: 5000 (WaitForSingleObject timeout)
   - Line 819: 1024 (snprintf buffer size)
   - Line 823: 5000 (WaitForSingleObject timeout)
   - Line 868: 200 (HTTP status code)

4. NULL POINTER CHECKS
   ✓ Most pointer dereferences have null checks
   ✓ g_ctx checked before use
   ✓ g_data checked before use
   ✓ g_response_data.buffer checked before free()

5. CODE STRUCTURE
   ✓ All global variables properly declared
   ✓ Functions properly structured
   ✓ No obvious syntax errors

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

1. Consider defining magic numbers as named constants:
   #define REGISTRY_KEY_NAME_SIZE 256
   #define PS_CMD_BUFFER_SIZE 1024
   #define REG_PATH_BUFFER_SIZE 512
   #define HTTP_STATUS_OK_CODE 200
   #define STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS 5000

2. The code structure is well-organized with global variables
   alphabetically sorted by type and name.

3. All memory management appears correct with proper
   allocation and deallocation patterns.

=== OVERALL ASSESSMENT ===
Code Quality: GOOD
- Safe memory management practices
- No unsafe string functions
- Proper null checks in critical paths
- Well-structured global variable organization

Minor Improvements:
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Consider additional null checks in some edge cases
